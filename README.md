Hi, I'm Roel from the beautiful coastal town of IJmuiden in The Netherlands.

On my GitHub I will be posting my hobby electronics and coding projects to share them with the rest of the world. Most projects in and of themselves are 
maybe not that complicated but take note that each of them contains a project documentation that takes you along all the choices and challenges I came
across in the project. If you are starting out (like me) you might run into some challenges (like me) that are not always discussed on other websites that
are mostly only focused on the end result and less on the journey. Because everything is a learning experience I wanted to share this part as well.

I hope you enjoy the projects and feel free to contact me on GitHub or LinkedIn.

Have fun!

Roel Janssen
